      'One of the most challenging aspects about organising team travel is picking a date. Finding a block of time that works for everyone’s schedule and an available venue can feel like an impossibility at times. NextRetreat’s Sync Calendar compares airports in your original locations and selected destination, thousands of return flights and other data, helping you choose the right dates for your trip.',
      'The results include a calendar matrix – departure & check-in on X axis and return & check out on Y, and the share of team members who can fly to the destination on specified dates based on flight availability. If your date range shows 100%, that means there are same day flights for all team members. If it shows less than 100%, click on the range to see which locations do not have a direct connection.',
