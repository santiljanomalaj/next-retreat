      “We took some time out as a team to celebrate Eradigm’s achievements to date & think about what the future might hold. NextRetreat helped us organising an amazing team retreat. Our Black-Tie dinner was a success, the venue was super nice, and we enjoyed the special atmosphere as well as the tasty food. The photographer joined us at the dinner, and he was super funny and nice, of course the team photos were stunning. Everything went very well, the team felt spoiled & motivated. Time to think about 2020!”

The host, Iria, was extremely helpful and made sure we didn’t have to focus on anything else than to be productive. She even picked up pizza for us one of the evenings when we were busy!”

The views are fabulous, every room and terrace has a view to the Atlantic with an amazing sunset every evening to look forward to. Our host Iria was an absolute diamond, nothing was too much trouble. Taxis are good and cheap, if you can at least one of you have a car for shopping etc. I would definitely come back to this villa, miss it already.”
